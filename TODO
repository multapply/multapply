TODO LIST
=========
- Handle banned users
  - Maybe banned table in DB
  - put "banned" in roles string for a banned user and check at every route
  - Definitely make sure to revoke all refresh tokens in the DB with the foreign
    key user_id that maps to a the banned user in users. 
  - Maybe new attribute is_banned for users in the model.

- Define constants for how long we want access/refresh tokens to last

X If user is created and inserted into DB but we encounter error after that
  we need to delete the user because the registration process as a WHOLE failed
  (do the same for errors that happen after creating the refresh_token and inserting)
